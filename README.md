    <img src="Enter_your_name.png" width="450" />  
  </p>  
    If two players:  
  <p align="left">
    <img src="Enter_player1.png" width="450" />
    <img src="Enter_player2.png" width="450" />
  </p>
- Then, the user should choose the difficulty of the game, as mentioned before, the choice of the user will depend on the speed of the ball and the size of the paddles:
